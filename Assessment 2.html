  <h2>History of Football</h2>
  <p>
    Football, also known as soccer in some countries, has ancient roots going back thousands of years, 
    with early forms played in China, Greece, and Rome. The modern version began to take shape in the 
    19th century in England, where standardized rules were introduced in 1863 with the formation of 
    The Football Association. From there, the sport spread rapidly across the globe, becoming the 
    world’s most popular and widely played game.
